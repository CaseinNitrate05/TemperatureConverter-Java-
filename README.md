🔥 **Project Title**:

**Temperature Converter Using Java Swing**


## 📝 **Project Description**:

The **Temperature Converter** is a desktop application developed using **Java Swing**, designed to perform conversions between **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit** temperatures. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to input a temperature value in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and convert it to the other unit with a single click.

This project is ideal for Java beginners as it covers essential topics such as:

* Swing GUI design
* Event-driven programming
* Basic arithmetic operations
* Type conversion and error-free user interaction

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**:

### 1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

* Built using Java’s Swing toolkit.
* Components used include:

  * `JFrame` – main application window
  * `JLabel` – for labels ("Celsius", "Fahrenheit")
  * `JTextField` – for user input
  * `JButton` – to trigger conversions

### 2. **Temperature Conversion:**

* **Celsius to Fahrenheit** conversion:

  * Formula: `F = (C × 9/5) + 32`
* **Fahrenheit to Celsius** conversion:

  * Formula: `C = (F − 32) × 5/9`
* User enters a value, clicks the appropriate button, and the result appears instantly.

### 3. **Event Handling:**

* Each button is linked to an `ActionListener` that responds to user clicks and performs the respective calculation.

## 📌 **Highlights**:

* User-friendly interface suitable for all age groups.
* Minimalistic design with two-way conversion.
* Encourages understanding of GUI-based desktop application development.
* Can be compiled and run directly from the command prompt using `javac` and `java` commands.

---

## 💡 **Possible Enhancements (Optional):**

* Input validation to handle invalid or non-numeric values.
* Additional temperature units like **Kelvin**.
* Use `GridLayout` or `BoxLayout` for improved layout design.
* Add a **Reset** button to clear input/output fields.

## 🎓 **Learning Outcomes**:

* Fundamentals of building Java GUI applications.
* Understanding how to use Swing components.
* Implementing action listeners for interactivity.
* Applying mathematical operations based on user input.
